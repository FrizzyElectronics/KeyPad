# KeyPad
The Keypad module carries 4 push buttons and uses 4 different values resistors to indicate which buttons are pressed. Four buttons using only one pin on your Arduino! With just an analogRead call you can know the button. The Keypad is great for greating game controllers in combination with 3D printing.
